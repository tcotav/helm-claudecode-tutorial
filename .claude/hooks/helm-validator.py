"""
Helm Command Validator for Claude Code
=======================================
Pre-execution hook that validates helm commands before Claude runs them.

Scoped to Helm chart development workflows. Encourages local validation
(lint, template) while blocking commands that deploy to clusters.

Behavior:
- BLOCKS: helm install, upgrade, uninstall, rollback, test (cluster mutations)
- PROMPTS: helm template, lint, show, dependency, package, etc. (local dev)
- LOGS: All helm command attempts to .claude/audit/helm-YYYY-MM-DD.log

Usage:
  This script is automatically invoked by Claude Code hooks.
  See .claude/settings.json for configuration.
